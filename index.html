            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born in Manhattan, NY, however I moved to Las Vegas, NV when I was 3 and lived there for 10 years
                before moving to Philadelphia, PA where I currently reside. I currently am employed at KPot Hotpot and
                Korean BBQ as a food server. Prior to that I had worked a variety of other restaurant jobs part-time &
                full time as a server, bartender, food runner, and also BOH as a kitchen prep. Other jobs I have worked
                outside of the food industry include Fitness Floor Attendant at my University gym, a Front desk
                Receptionist at my University's Deans Office of Student Life, and also as a Medical Billing and Coding
                Associate/Fronk desk Receptionist at a privately-owned Urgent Care Clinic. My hobbies include traveling
                and trying new delicious foods, video gaming, networking, and learning new things. I have also found
                myself interested in learning code ðŸ˜Š. </p>
